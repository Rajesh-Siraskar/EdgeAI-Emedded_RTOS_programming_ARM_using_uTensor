uTensor is an extremely light-weight machine learning inference framework built on Tensorflow and optimized for Arm targets. It consists of a runtime library and an offline tool that handles most of the model translation work. This repo holds the core runtime and some example implementations of operators, memory managers/schedulers, and more, and the size of the core runtime is only ~2KB!
